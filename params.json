{"name":"ProjectEuler+","tagline":"Cache of Project Euler problems and solutions","body":"[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/stvhwrd/ProjectEuler](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/stvhwrd/ProjectEuler?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home of my (often feeble) attempts at [Project Euler] (https://projecteuler.net/) challenges.   This repo includes a cache of all Project Euler challenge questions for offline (i.e. long plane rides) access.  Big thanks to Kyle Keen's [Local Euler](http://kmkeen.com/local-euler) for making that possible.\r\n\r\nAfter once through the normal [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), I will move on to [ProjectEuler+ on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges).  The challenges are basically the same but the test cases are hidden (and include edge case tests) and computation time and resources are limited.  \r\n\r\n### Languages\r\nI tend to try first in C and then, once solved, move into a different language such as Java or Python.  As such, my final solutions are often quite... non-idiomatic.  Like, *really* not idiomatic at all (is there a word for that?). I have this horrible tendency to try to translate my methods word-for-word from C into other languages.  It's exactly as ineffective as it seems.  \r\n\r\n*The struggle is real.*\r\n\r\n### Code Comments\r\nI also have not bothered to comment most of these solutions, although if I were particularly proud of one I might take the time to comment/narrate it thoroughly.\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nSome of the first solutions were copy and pasted from my own solutions on HackerRank ProjectEuler+, where the secret test files are input rather than a hardcoded value as per original Projet Euler.\r\n\r\nAs a result there may be some scanning in and printing out of various values that wouldn't be necessary for the normal projecteuler.net problems.\r\n\r\nThis is just a low-priority housekeeping issue which I intend to address sometime in the next few months (after exams).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
